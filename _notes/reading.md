Knowing how to read well is a key skill to save time and be effective. It is
not about how much time you spent reading a text but about how much you can
get out of it. The following resources will give you a good place to start
thinking critically and reflectively about your readings. And, just as with
everything in life, perfection comes with practice.

* Start by the advice on reading academic papers provided in the Module
  Handbook.
