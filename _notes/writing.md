In addition to the information provided in the Module Handbook, I recommend
consulting the following texts by Deirdre McCloskey:

* *"Other things equal - Economical Writing: An Executive Summary"* ([pdf](http://www.deirdremccloskey.org/docs/pdf/Article_309.pdf)) by Deirdre McCloskey.

This is a summary of her fantastic book [*"The Writing of Economics"*](http://www.amazon.com/Economical-Writing-Second-Deirdre-McCloskey/dp/1577660633/ref=pd_sim_b_2), most recommended in itself.
