Citations are a key component of Academic writing. We sure [stand on the
shoulders of giants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_on_the_shoulders_of_giants) 
but it is key to give credit where credit is due. Lack of or improper citing
can result in plagiarism, which is a (very) serious matter. In this page, you
will find some basic reference on how to cite and a few links to different
tools that can help you cite properly without much hassle.

Citation essentially implies to attribute bits of knowledge you have borrowed
from other sources to their original author, within the text you are writing.
There are two basic aspects to understand about citation: one is conceptual
(why and what to do) and the other one is technical (how to specifically do it).

### Basic rules of citation

Conceptually, citing implies recognizing who produced or pushed forward the
idea you are using in your manuscript that is not yours. This means that,
whenever you mention a concept, result or any bit of knowledge you have learnt
from somewhere (i.e. it is not of your authorship), you need to properly
express where it comes from. This is usually done in two parts:

* Within the text, insert a mark with the author name and year of publication
  (specific details may vary, see next section)
* At the end of the text, create a section called "References" where you list
  in alphabetical order all the publications you refer to in the text

Depending on the nature of the manuscript you are preparing, you will have
different requirements as to how to present this, so make sure you know the
rules by which you have to play. In any case, two general principles apply
always: **consistency** and **full matching**. Being consistent implies to
pick one way of mentioning publications and using it throughout the document.
A full matching means that each and every of your citations mentioned in the
text has a reference in the references list, and that every single publication
mentioned in the references list appears in the text at least once.

Have a look at the following two resources to dig further on how to cite
properly:

        referencing](https://intranet.birmingham.ac.uk/as/libraryservices/library/referencing/icite/index.aspx)
(including link to different tools).

### Citation and references tools

The technical part of referencing is much simpler (not neccesarily easier).
There are many options as to how you can insert citations (see this WikiPedia [list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citation)) or manage your references
in a paper, from entering them manually to fully automated systems of relative
complexity. At the end of the day, it all boils down to a personal choice,
play with a few of the options and find the one that best fits your needs and
preferences. But remember, the most efficient route in the middle run is not
neccessarily the fastest one to learn or the quickest one the first time you
use it, so be patient and give yourself time to get proficient with your
choice.

General popular options:

* [Mendeley](http://www.mendeley.com/): cloud/local system to manage
  bibliographies and reference lists.
* [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/): bibliography manager (open source).
* [EndNote](http://endnote.com/): bibliography manager and referencing system
  (proprietary).

Options specifically designed for particular typesetting systems:

* [BibTex](http://www.bibtex.org/): bibliography manager and referencing system (open source, built to work with [LaTeX](http://www.latex-project.org/)).
* [Microsoft Word](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Create-a-bibliography-3403c027-96c8-40d3-a386-bfd5c413ddbb?ui=en-US&rs=en-US&ad=US) also has built-in functionality for bibliography.

management software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_reference_management_software).
