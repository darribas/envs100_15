Having smart and intelligent ways to look for relevant literature is nowadays
almost as important as reading the found references. Literature search is a
bit of an art as much as it is a science, and expertise and mastery comes with
time and experience. However, there are a few basic rules and tips that can
help you in starting off in the right direction.

In this page, you will find listed resources where you can perform such
searches, as well as tips to be able to select among the list of results you
will obtain.

### Resources

Physical resources:

* Library/ies
* Inter-library loans
* Book reservations
* ...

Digital:

* [University of Liverpool Library](http://libguides.liv.ac.uk/library)
* [Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.co.uk/)
* [Microsoft Academic Search](http://academic.research.microsoft.com/)
* [Thomson Reuters Web of Science](http://webofknowledge.com)

### Relevance of Articles

The problem nowadays is not to find articles related to a discipline as much
as to select, from the large amount of references that come up in a search,
those that are relevant. There is not a single recipe for evaluating the
relevance of an article but some of the following indicators can collectively
help you evaluate how important a publication can be.

* Type of publication. journal articles are typically the most important ones
  as they have gone through a peer-review process. Books are relevant in
  collecting the main ideas and advancements in a field and summarizing them
  in an organized way. Reports can be good if they are very close to the topic
  you are researching but typically have less recognition.
* How close the text's topic is to your research interest. The closer the
  more relevant.
* How old the publication is. The older, the more chances of having an impact
  it has (i.e. it might be more cited), but it also has more chance of being
  outdated or obsolete.
* Number of overall citations the manuscript has received, particularly in relation
  to how old the publication is.
* The prestige of the journal where it is published. More prestigious journals
  and publishers
  are harder to get published in and hence, everything else equal, apply a
  more strict filter that results in better quality publications.
* How often it is referenced by other articles/books/reports in the close circle of what the
  publication is about.

### Relevance of Journals

Besides finding articles, it is usually useful to have a sense whether the
journals where they are published has a good reputation. It is very hard to
get an exact quick answer, but it is possible to get an impression by looking
at some of the following factors:

* [Impact factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_factor). Typically
  explicitly mentioned in the journal's website, or available through
  providers (for pay) like Thomson Reuters. Mostly useful to compare with
  other similar journals, hard across disciplines.
* [EigenFactor](http://eigenfactor.org/). It tries to get at some of the
  problems of impact factors. Better to compare across disciplines.
